# VR Public Speaking Anxiety Solution

## Project Overview

Welcome to our project repository, submitted for the Google Solution Challenge! Our mission is to address the widespread issue of public speaking anxiety by leveraging the immersive capabilities of Virtual Reality (VR) environments. We are committed to creating a solution that not only empowers individuals to overcome their fear of public speaking but also aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a particular focus on health and well-being, peace, justice, strong institutions, and decent work and economic growth.

## Objectives

### 1. Health and Well-being
- **Objective:** Improve mental health by providing a targeted solution for individuals grappling with public speaking anxiety.
- **Approach:** Utilize VR technology to create a secure and controlled environment, fostering a therapeutic experience for users.

### 2. Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions
- **Objective:** Promote mental resilience and emotional well-being, contributing to a society with stronger, more confident individuals.
- **Approach:** Empower users with tools to build confidence, enabling them to engage effectively in social and professional settings.

### 3. Decent Work and Economic Growth
- **Objective:** Enhance individuals' employability and career prospects by addressing a common obstacle â€“ public speaking anxiety.
- **Approach:** Equip users with the skills and confidence needed to excel in professional environments, supporting their personal and economic growth.

## Therapeutic Process: Flooding in VR Environments

Our innovative approach involves the application of a therapeutic technique known as "flooding" within VR environments. This process entails users gradually exposing themselves to the sensations and emotions associated with addressing large audiences. The VR simulations are designed to simulate realistic scenarios, allowing users to:

- Experience a range of audience sizes and reactions.
- Practice various speaking styles and content delivery.
- Receive instant feedback and performance evaluations.
